                Torture and inhumane treatments in rehabilitation centers are violations of human rights.
                It's our collective responsibility to raise awareness and make a change.

            <h2>The Reality Behind Many Rehab Facilities in Nepal</h2>
            <p>
                A significant proportion of rehab facilities in Nepal are managed and operated by former drug and alcohol users. While their lived experiences bring a unique understanding of the struggles faced by those in rehab, many of these individuals lack formal certifications in drug and alcohol rehabilitation. The absence of standardized training and oversight can lead to questionable practices in these centers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In numerous facilities, the emphasis is on strict discipline and control, sometimes to the detriment of the patients. Examples of such stringent rules include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients needing to request permission even for basic necessities like drinking water.</li>
                <li>Restrictions on restroom use during sessions, with some classes led by individuals who have merely been in the facility for a longer duration.</li>
                <li>Threats of severe punitive measures for those not adhering to these 'rules'.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's imperative that rehabilitation centers provide a compassionate and educated approach to recovery. The emphasis should be on healing and understanding, not fear and strict discipline.
